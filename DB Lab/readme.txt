TwitterLab - INFO 154 Lab 3
===========================
This folder holds the files for lab 3 of INFO 154. Work was done by Gregory Woods and Stephen Weber again. This builds off of lab 2 (yay recycled code!) to save tweet search results to an SQL database. A new page was built to display the saved results, called history.php.

Required SQL setup:
Schema = info154
Table = tweets
User = infousr
Password = D1oASa1
Permissions = All but administration tasks (meaning not a clone of root; just give permissions to read, write, and edit a table)
Columns (in this order):
tweet_text
user_name
tweet_time
tweet_id
