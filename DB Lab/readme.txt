TwitterLab - INFO 154 Lab 2
===========================
This folder holds the files for lab 2 of INFO 154. Work was done by Gregory Woods and Stephen Weber (and yes, Greg worked his ass off even with less commits. Nevermind that he owes me a beer :P) Everything should be relative links so you should be able to fork this to and run on your own machine. If using XAMPP, beware of the cURL issue with the Twitter API (quick fix, but a pain in the ass if you don't know about it.)

Don't steal my API keys. They'll be revoked soon anyway, but I'll still hunt you down.
